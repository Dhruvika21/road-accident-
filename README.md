# Analyzing Traffic Accident Data
This repository contains scripts and notebooks to analyze traffic accident data, focusing on identifying patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The goal is to visualize accident hotspots and understand contributing factors using data science techniques.

# Dataset
The analysis is based on a publicly available dataset of traffic accidents. The dataset includes information such as:

Accident location (latitude, longitude) <br>
Date and time of the accident<br>
Road conditions (e.g., wet, dry, icy)<br>
Weather conditions (e.g., clear, rainy, foggy)<br>
Accident severity and type<br>
Contributing factors (e.g., speeding, distracted driving)<br>

# Tools Used
Python for data analysis (Pandas, NumPy)<br>
Visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)<br>
